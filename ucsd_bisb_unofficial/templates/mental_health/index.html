  There is a [mental health crisis](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4089) in
  academia. Graduate students suffer from depression and anxiety at
  [higher rates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733317300422)
  compared with people in other "highly educated" career paths. It is not
  uncommon for students in our very own program to seek treatment for mental
  illnesses.
