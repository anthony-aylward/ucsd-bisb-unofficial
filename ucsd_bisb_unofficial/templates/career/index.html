  For scientists, finishing a Ph.D. or postdoc and automatically moving on to a research-faculty position is no longer the
  norm. In fact, the share of all U.S. science and engineering doctorate recipients working in academe dropped from 55%
  to 44% between 1973 and 2008; that percentage includes postdocs, staff scientists, research and teaching faculty, and
  administrators. Within academe, the proportion of scientists employed in tenured or tenure-track positions has also declined
  [...] likely reflecting a growth in postdoctoral, staff scientist, and other nonâ€“tenure-track slots. And with a growing
  population of talented trainees poised to enter the job market, the competition for sought-after academic jobs is tough.
