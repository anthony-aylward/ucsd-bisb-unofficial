  For scientists, finishing a Ph.D. or postdoc and automatically moving on to a research-faculty position is no longer the
  norm. In fact, the share of all U.S. science and engineering doctorate recipients working in academe dropped from 55% to
  44% between 1973 and 2008; that percentage includes postdocs, staff scientists, research and teaching faculty, and administrators.
  Within academe, the proportion of scientists employed in tenured or tenure-track positions has also declined [...] likely
  reflecting a growth in postdoctoral, staff scientist, and other nonâ€“tenure-track slots. And with a growing population of
  talented trainees poised to enter the job market, the competition for sought-after academic jobs is tough.

  A feature allowing users to submit/browse job listings that have circulated through the program
  via emails, the slack channel, etc. would be nice to have on this page
