Please see the steps below to set up a TAship during the 2019-20 year.

- Students need to apply for TAship using ASES system if required by the hiring department. Not all TAships will be listed in this system.
- Students enroll in BNFO500 under Dr Ideker
    - Students need to register for each TAship, even if they have already met the minimum TA requirement
    - Should not count towards the minimum 12 unit requirement
    - Submit an EASY request for either 2 or 4 units, include class information, instructor information, paid or unpaid, etc
        - (https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/Modules/Students/PreAuth/)
- Attached TA form needs to be completed by both student and faculty, and returned to me before start of TAship
    - 25% is 2 units, 110 hours
    - 50% is 4 units, 220 hours

of the official website.

<p class="lead">A BISB student asked:</p>
{{
  macros.quote(
    'Anyone have any advice on how to find TA positions? I\'m probably quite
    late for Fall positions but I\'m not sure I even know the best way to find
    them.',
    'OP'
  )
}}
<p class="lead">Another student gave this advice:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Look at what’s being offered in the Fall and email professors directly if
    you are interested in TAing their course. I think I blasted out like 10
    emails one quarter.
  </li>
  <li>
    Like Bill mentioned, get in touch with the Admins. Personally, I’d reach
    out to the Bioengineering, CSE, and Biomedical Informatics (Elizabeth
    Santillanez esantillanez@ucsd.edu).
  </li>
  <li>
    CSE has a <a href="https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/Modules/ASES/Apply.aspx?cid=2474">formal TAship application</a>,
    however it looks like the priority deadline has passed
  </li>
  <li>
    Open positions can be found <a href="https://academicaffairs.ucsd.edu/Modules/ASES/OpenPositions.aspx">here</a>,
    but I’m not sure how relevant they are
  </li>
  <li>
    If there is some urgency (e.g. you need to complete your TAship immediately
    for some reason) talk to Vineet Bafna.
  </li>
</ol>
